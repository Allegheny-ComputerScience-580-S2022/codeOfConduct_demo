## Categories of Conduct

## Overall Conduct

This section defines how each class member should and should not act while
participating in a computer science course at Allegheny College. Everyone is
required to adhere to not only this section, but also the following eight
sections of this Code of Conduct. Most important in this section is that
members respect their peers, regardless of race or gender, as learners. This
is a course in which individuals have different skillsets and different
levels of mastery in those skills, and disrespecting or shunning a class member
for lack of knowledge violates this Code of Conduct. Viewing and using other
people's work is a core part of learning  how to learn and code effectively, yet
when used irresponsibly (such as directly copying another peer's work without their
permission or without crediting them) such code will negatively impact
learning success. Therefore, members of this course should adhere to
Allegheny's honor code for all submitted work.

* Acceptable Conduct (A):
  * Members shall ...

* Unacceptable Conduct (U):
  * Members shall not ...

### Attendance

Students are expected to attend class sessions and laboratory sessions in person
and remotely depending on what attendance group they were assigned at the start
of the semester. In addition to that and due to the nature of the course students
should also be expected to communicate and work collaboratively outside of class
with team members on a laboratory or project assignment. There are exceptions to
this rule that take into account emergencies and illnesses.

* Acceptable Conduct (A):
  * Members shall ...


* Unacceptable Conduct (U):
  * Members shall not ...


### Deadlines

Students are expected to follow the due dates of assignments online through the
course website and on Slack. Exceptions should be made for emergencies and illnesses.

* Unacceptable Conduct (U):

### Communication

Since the nature of this course has changed communication is more vital than ever
for students. Students are expected to stay in regular communication and
watch and participate in Slack, Zoom, and email communications.

  * Members shall ...

* Unacceptable Conduct (U):
  * Members shall not ...


## Team Work

Some of the class activities and lab projects will require team collaboration.
This section of the Code of Conduct will provide guidance on effective and
inclusive team work.

### Participation

Every class member needs to be actively and cooperatively involved with the
class activities and lab projects at hand. This will ensure the
flow of questions, ideas, and thoughts in a respectful manner. Our learning
environment at its root includes participation, candidness
and insightful collaboration. Participating in team-based project discussion means
engaging in conversation, not just answering questions. The goal here is to show up and
truly be all there.

* Acceptable Conduct (A):
  * Members shall ...


* Unacceptable Conduct (U):
  * Members shall not ...


### Decisions

The majority of individuals in a team should agree on a given decision before the
project is implemented. It should be made with supporting evidence that shows
that the decision is productive. When unsure about making a decision
it is a good idea to defer to a technical leader or the professor. One should
reach out to other teams whom the choice will influence. Teams will determine
how long a decision will take to implement.

* Acceptable Conduct (A):
  * Members shall ...


* Unacceptable Conduct (U):
  * Members shall not ...


### Postmortems

Postmortems are great ways of looking at and analyzing the performance of
the project after its launch. Through postmortems we can look at what was
successful and what failed and needs improvement. These discussions also
provide great insight in how to improve in future projects.

* Acceptable Conduct (A):
  * Members shall ...


* Unacceptable Conduct (U):
  * Members shall not ...


### Conflicts

It is inevitable that conflicts will arise when working as a large group. It is essential, however, to resolve these conflicts in a professional manner while keeping in mind the concerns of everyone involved.

* Acceptable Conduct (A):
  * Members shall ...

* Unacceptable Conduct (U):
  * Members shall not ...
    * Encourage or engage in conflicts that undermine the Code of Conduct
    * Escalate existing conflicts that jeopardize the group project
    * Disregard or refuse to resolve an existing conflict that has been brought to their attention
    * Harass others with discriminatory jokes and languages
    * Hold grudges against others for previous conflicts
    * Hide conflicts within a group to prevent interventions to mitigate problems
    * Physically injure others or try or attack members in order to resolve conflicts

## Infractions

An infraction occurs when class member(s) violate the agreed
rules present in the Code of Conduct. Any action
that is considered "Unacceptable" will cause an
infraction. Class member(s) should avoid infractions since the accumulation of
them would cause penalties and hinder the progress of the project.

The severity of the infraction is determined by the number of
previous infractions. Higher number of past infractions would cause a higher
level infraction and thus a more severe penalty.

This guideline for infractions is separate from the Allegheny College Honor Code
guidelines. While the Honor Code involves all students in Allegheny College and
is enforced by the college's Honor Committee, this Code of Conduct only
includes members of the computer science class.

* *Infractions shall be imposed at three different levels of severity:*

* Level I: Any violation of a Code of Conduct rule is by default a Level I infraction. Technical leaders and instructor will be keeping track of infractions.

  - Warning to the student not to repeat their behavior
  - The offending student must commit to working towards amending the infraction and avoiding future infractions.

* Level II: Upon the accumulation of three level I infractions, project managers and the instructor will issue a formal level II infraction.

  - Student must formally apologize to the affected party.

  - Student is required to communicate with the professor to discuss continued participation in class.

  - Student may receive a reduced or failing grade for the affected project.

* Level III A Level III infraction will be given to an individual who has accumulated five Level I infractions.

  - Student is required to communicate weekly with the professor to discuss continued participation in class.
  - Depending on the severity of the infraction, student may receive a failing grade for the project and/or class, at the discretion of the professor.

Class member(s) are encouraged to report any infractions in order to ensure
a safe, inclusive and collegiate environment.

Class member(s) may appeal any infraction to the instructor of the class.
Any decision made by the instructor for the given infraction(s) will be final.
